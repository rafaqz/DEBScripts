These scripts accompany the paper:

"Integrating dynamic plant growth models and microclimates for species
distribution modelling" by Rafael Schouten, Peter Vesk and Michael Kearney, in the
Journal of Ecological modelling.

_Growth plots at three transect locations in NSW, Australia, starting each month for 6 years_ 

Scripts are provided for building al the plots from the paper, and also for
using the interactive user-interface used to examine and simplify the model.


To set up, run julia in this folder, then run:

```julia-repl
]
activate .
instantiate
```

Where `]` gets you into Pkg mode in the REPL. 

After that you can hit escape to leave the Pkg mode, and use the scripts:

- ui.jl loads the interactive user interface
- paper_plots.jl builds plots for the paper

As loading all the packages will take quite a while, load these in a julia
session that you keep open (ie in Atom/Juno), instead of running them from the
command line each time.


If you have any problems, open an issue in this repository, including your
version of Julia, description of the problem and error outputs where necessary.



![User interface](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/rafaqz/DEBplant/master/plots/ui.png)
_User interface generated by the `ui.jl` script. Components can be added and swapped out from
the interface, parameters can be adjusted, and spefic variables and flux components can be visualised._
